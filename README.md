# azsctl

![CodeQL](https://github.com/FrodeHus/azsctl/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)

Simple tool to do maintenace tasks with Azure Senitel from CLI instead of web - might change 'simple' to 'advanced' later.

## Installation

Tried to make it as simple as possible so... try:

`python3 -m pip install azsctl`

(Won't work right now since I'm since working towards a stable first release)

## Usage

`azsctl login` to get started.
