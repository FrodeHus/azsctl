Simple tool to do maintenace tasks with Azure Senitel from CLI instead of web - might change 'simple' to 'advanced' later.

## Installation

Tried to make it as simple as possible so... try:

`python3 -m pip install azsctl`

### Enable tab completion

`source azsctl.completion.sh`

## Usage

`azsctl login` to get started.

```text

Took a lot of inspiration (and some code lines) from [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) to bend [urwid](https://urwid.org) to my will.
